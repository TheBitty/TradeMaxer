# Development Log - TradingSystem Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress, code changes, and implementation details for the TradingSystem. It serves as a living documentation of how the code works and why certain decisions were made.

## Development Timeline

### Session 1: Project Setup (Current)
**Date**: Starting implementation
**Goal**: Set up project structure and documentation framework

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Project Structure Setup
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Purpose**: Establish organized project structure following architecture principles

Key features:
- Main entry point (main.cpp) as minimal coordinator
- Modular design with separate components
- Documentation structure for AI context
- Build system configuration

**Directory Structure Created**:
```
TradingSystem/
├── docs/                    # Documentation
│   ├── ai/                  # AI context files
│   ├── technical/           # Technical documentation
│   ├── planning/            # Project planning
│   └── logging/             # Development tracking
├── specs/                   # Feature specifications
├── src/                     # Source code (to be created)
├── tests/                   # Test files (to be created)
└── build/                   # Build artifacts (to be created)
```

### 2. Build System Configuration
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Purpose**: CMake-based build system for C++ compilation

Key features:
- CMakeLists.txt for build configuration
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Debug and release configurations
- Test integration support

---

## Code Architecture

### Component Relationships
```
main.cpp (Entry Point)
├── Core Trading Engine (to be implemented)
├── Market Data Handler (to be implemented)
├── Risk Management (to be implemented)
└── Configuration Manager (to be implemented)
```

### Data Flow (Planned)
1. Market data ingestion
2. Signal processing and analysis
3. Trading decision logic
4. Order execution
5. Risk management checks
6. Portfolio management
7. Logging and monitoring

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why C++ as primary language?
- High performance requirements for trading systems
- Low latency execution critical
- Direct memory management for optimization
- Extensive financial libraries available

### 2. Why modular architecture?
- Separation of concerns for maintainability
- Independent testing of components
- Scalability for multi-process deployment
- Easy to replace individual components

### 3. Why comprehensive documentation structure?
- AI-assisted development requires context
- Complex financial domain needs clear documentation
- Multi-developer team coordination
- Regulatory compliance documentation
